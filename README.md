### Email

An important group of setting to be aware of are the ones based around email.
By default, the [_'django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend'_](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/email/#file-backend) is used.
In a production environment, this backend should be replaced by the [_'django.core.mail.backends.smpt.EmailBackend'_](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/email/#smtp-backend).
Read the linked documentation for information on setting this up.

### Company Settings

For personalization and routing, the *APP_URL* and *COMPANY_NAME* configuration items should be set after initializing your envionrment, setting up DNS routing, and creating an initial company.

## Features

The AMP system offers many different features and capabilities that are defined and reachable through the dashboard.

### Structure

Each key feature of AMP is broken down into either a list page with individual detail or a single detail page.

* List Pages:
    * List pages offer the ability to _Create_, _Edit_, _Delete_, _Search_, and _Export_ the data they represent. If you click on the edit, _pencil_ icon, you will be redirected the the individual detail page.
* Detail Pages:
    * Detail pages offer the ability to modify a single object.

### Notifications

The AMP system sends many alerts and notifications that react to user input and regular time schedules.

* Employee Request Notification: 
    * Employee request notifications are sent upon an employee registering into the system. This registration occurs on the unauthenticated landing page found under the _Make Employee Request_ heading.
    * This notification is sent to all users of the requested Company.

* Contractor Request Notification: 
    * Contractor request notifications are sent upon a contractor registering into the system. This registration occurs on the unauthenticated landing page found under the _Make Contractor Request_ heading.
    * This notification is sent to all users of the requested Company.

* Recurring Log Notification:
    * The entire log count will be sent via email to all company users at an interval set through the _Log Reccurence_ input on the _Settings_ page.
    * By default, these logs will be mailed out once per day.
